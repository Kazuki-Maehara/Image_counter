# Image_counter
This program counts objects(only black). Written in Python.
To use this program, you need only a USB camera.

First of all, you teach the program an edge of a container.
It can separate an upper rectangle area of a container into 72 points,
and get average values of each of these.
Then it makes a decision that there is a black stuff or not.
